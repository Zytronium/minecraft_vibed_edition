CLAUDE AI INSTRUCTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

Ensure all code is well documented. Do not remove comments unless the
functionality of the code has changed or the comment is irrelevant now
(i.e. "// add this line" should be removed)

Keep things well organized by using multiple files when best practice recommends
to do so.

Embed all game assets into the compiled program so nohting relies on an external
path. This allows the compiled program to run in any file location on any
compatible Linux computer because the required game assets are embedded in the
executable program.

When editing multiple files, ensure you create an artifact for each one you edit.
Don't just use one single artifact.
