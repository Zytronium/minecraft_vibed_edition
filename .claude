CLAUDE AI INSTRUCTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

Ensure all code is well documented. Do not remove comments unless the
functionality of the code has changed or the comment is irrelevant now
(i.e. "// add this line" should be removed)

Keep things well organized by using multiple files when best practice recommends
to do so.
